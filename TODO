1 use cscope in vim with php
2 update phpm
3 other 
4 check phpcs use,and uncomment later
5 search in floder
在当前目录下查找含有“getInfo”的php文档，但不跳到第一个匹配
:vimgrep /getInfo/gj ./*/*.php
如果要包含子文件夹，则用
:vimgrep /getInfo/gj ./**/*.php
:cw
打开quickfix窗口查看匹配结果
:vim[grep][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file}
Search for {pattern} in the files {file} … and set
the error list to the matches.
Without the ‘g’ flag each line is added only once.
With ‘g’ every match is added.

{pattern} is a Vim search pattern.  Instead of
enclosing it in / any non-ID character (see
|’isident’|) can be used, so long as it does not
appear in {pattern}.
‘ignorecase’ applies.  To overrule it put |/c| in the
pattern to ignore case or |/C| to match case.
‘smartcase’ is not used.

When a number is put before the command this is used
as the maximum number of matches to find.  Use
“:1vimgrep pattern file” to find only the first.
Useful if you only want to check if there is a match
and quit quickly when it’s found.

Without the ‘j’ flag Vim jumps to the first match.
With ‘j’ only the quickfix list is updated.
With the [!] any changes in the current buffer are
abandoned.
